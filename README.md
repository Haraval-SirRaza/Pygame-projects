🎮 Haraval's Game
Welcome to Haraval's Game, a simple but fun Python game built using the Pygame library! In this game, you control a white square (the player) and collect black blocks (points) to increase your score. The challenge? The point blocks move every 10 seconds, so keep moving fast!

🕹️ How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the player:

Collect the black square to earn points.

The point square moves to a new random location every 10 seconds.

Try to get as many points as you can!
