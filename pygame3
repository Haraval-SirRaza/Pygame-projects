Haraval's 3-Player Pygame

A simple and fun 3-player game built with Python's `pygame` library. Players compete to collect a moving box within a 60-second time limit. The player with the highest score wins!

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🧍‍♂️ Three-player simultaneous gameplay on the same keyboard
- 🎯 Random target box that gives points on collision
- ⏱️ 60-second timer to finish the game
- 🏆 Scoreboard and winner announcement
- 🚧 Boundary limits so cars don’t go off screen

## 🧠 How to Play

### Controls:

| Player | Movement Keys       |
|--------|---------------------|
| Car 1  | Arrow Keys (↑ ↓ ← →) |
| Car 2  | `Q`, `W`, `U`, `D`   |
| Car 3  | `K`, `L`, `G`, `H`   |

Each player moves their car to collide with the yellow box on the screen. When a car hits the box, they earn 1 point and the box relocates randomly. After 60 seconds, the scores are displayed, and the winner is announced.
